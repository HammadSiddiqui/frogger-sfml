Game Design

________________
Summary
      This game is designed for the final project of a course: Computational Thinking II, at Habib University. The game is built on SFML. Using terminal:
              -        Download the game from GitHub: 
git clone https://github.com/HammadSiddiqui/frogger-sfml        
* Install SFML using Homebrew: brew install sfml
* Use cmake or an IDE, like Clion, that supports compilation via MakeFiles to compile the program. The make files are included in the project.
* Enjoy the Game!




Gameplay
        This is a 2 dimensional game in which a frog needs to cross a road and a river without colliding to an obstacle. The frog needs to reach its friend waiting on the other side. 
The obstacles appear in two forms:
        -        Queue of vehicles running either left or right of the screen
        -        River Water 



Technical

Screens
1. Welcome Screen
2. Main Game Play Screen

* Down key to move the frog Down
* Right key to move the frog right
* Left key to move the frog right
Mechanics
        The cars and log move left and right on a constant y-axis. The frog can move either x-axis or y-axis.





Development

The Game() class
1. Constructor
   1. initWindow()
   2. initCars()
   3. initFrog()
   4. initWoods()
   5. initScorecard()
1. run()
              a.        processEvents()
              b.        update()
                c.         render()
All the “init” methods are called inside the constructor to generate all graphics and position them correctly before the game begins.
The real time game happens inside the run function which calls:
* processEvents(): to keep track of all the events happening inside the window.
* update(): the main logic of the game computed based on the typr of events recieved from processEvents.
* render(): this method renders the new values/position of the graphics on the window.
